# AI Context Sync Guide

## When Working with Multiple AI Assistants Simultaneously

If you're using multiple AI coding assistants at the same time (e.g., Claude Code + Cursor), use this prompt at the start of each new session to level-set context:

---

### üìã Quick Sync Prompt

```
IMPORTANT: I'm working with multiple AI assistants simultaneously.

Current State:
- Another AI assistant (Cursor/Claude/etc.) has made uncommitted changes to the codebase
- What you see in git may NOT reflect what's actually running on localhost
- Always check the ACTUAL file contents, not your assumptions

Before making changes:
1. Read the current state of files you're about to modify
2. Ask me to confirm what's running on localhost vs production
3. Don't assume git status = current codebase state
4. If something seems wrong, CHECK THE FILES FIRST before making assumptions

Context I need to share:
- Localhost is running on: [URL/PORT]
- Production is running on: [URL]
- Other AI has modified: [list files if known]
- Current issue: [describe what's different between localhost and production]
```

## What Went Wrong in Our Session

### The Issue
1. **You told me**: "Localhost shows perfect cards, but production shows extra phantom cards"
2. **What I assumed**: The committed code must be wrong
3. **What was actually true**: Cursor had made changes that weren't committed yet, so localhost was running DIFFERENT code than what I saw in git
4. **Result**: I "fixed" code that wasn't actually broken, temporarily breaking your localhost

### What Would Have Helped

Starting the session with:

```
Hey! Quick heads up before we start:

I'm running both you (Claude Code) and Cursor side-by-side on the same codebase.
Cursor has already made changes that fix localhost - those changes might not be
committed yet.

Before you make ANY changes:
1. Read the actual file contents (don't trust your memory)
2. The issue is that PRODUCTION has stale data, not that the CODE is wrong
3. Localhost = correct behavior (this is our source of truth)
4. Production = wrong behavior (probably stale cache or localStorage)

The problem is environment/deployment, not code logic.
```

## Best Practices for Multi-AI Workflows

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Start each session with context**: "I'm using multiple AIs, check files first"
- **Specify source of truth**: "Localhost is correct, production is wrong"
- **Mention uncommitted changes**: "Another AI made changes that work locally"
- **Be explicit about the problem domain**: "This is a deployment issue, not code issue"
- **Ask AI to read files before modifying**: "Check what's actually in the file first"

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Assume the AI knows about other AI's changes
- Let AI assume git = current state
- Assume AI remembers context from previous sessions (each session is fresh)
- Let AI make assumptions about what's "probably" wrong

## Session Start Template

Copy/paste this at the start of debugging sessions:

```
üîÑ MULTI-AI CONTEXT SYNC

Working With: [Claude Code / Cursor / Other]
Localhost: [URL] - [CORRECT/INCORRECT behavior]
Production: [URL] - [CORRECT/INCORRECT behavior]

Recent Changes:
- [Another AI / You] modified: [list of files]
- These changes [ARE / ARE NOT] committed to git
- Git status may not reflect actual running code

Source of Truth:
- [Localhost / Production] has the DESIRED behavior
- [Localhost / Production] has the PROBLEM we're fixing

Problem Domain:
- [ ] Code logic bug
- [ ] Build/compilation issue
- [ ] Deployment/cache issue
- [ ] Environment/localStorage issue
- [ ] Database/API issue

Before you start:
1. Read actual file contents, don't assume
2. Ask clarifying questions about what's committed vs uncommitted
3. Confirm your understanding of what's working vs broken
```

## Why This Matters

### AI Assistants Are Stateless
- Each new session has NO memory of previous sessions
- They can't see what other AIs have done
- They make reasonable assumptions based on incomplete information
- Git status ‚â† actual codebase when you have uncommitted changes

### The Fix
Give explicit context at the start of EVERY new session, especially when:
- Using multiple AI tools simultaneously
- Debugging localhost vs production differences
- Working with uncommitted changes
- Switching between different problem domains

## Example: How To Use This Guide

### ‚ùå Bad Start:
```
User: "My production site doesn't match localhost"
AI: *assumes code is wrong, starts modifying files*
```

### ‚úÖ Good Start:
```
User: "Quick sync: I'm using both you and Cursor. Cursor fixed localhost
(uncommitted changes). Production has stale data. This is a deployment
issue, not a code issue. Before you change anything, read the actual
files to see what Cursor did."

AI: *reads files, understands context, focuses on deployment/cache
solutions instead of code changes*
```

## Quick Reference Card

**Start every debugging session with:**
1. üîÑ "I'm using multiple AIs"
2. üìÅ "Check actual files, not git"
3. ‚úÖ "Localhost = source of truth"
4. üéØ "This is a [deployment/code/cache] issue"
5. üö´ "Don't assume, ask questions first"

led to unnecessary code changes. Use it to save time and prevent confusion!_
